I am using Sqlmodel to store data of the notes user will create.


## Idea Behind this Application:

1. I am thinking first to make a User table where i will have user informations.
2. I will have a Note section to store teh note the user will create.

Here User - Note: One - Many ðŸ“¢


1. first commit i did only add a simple user data storing mechanish

2. Now in the second commit i will make a separate logic of data notes keeping idea

3. I make my a sample checking funcions.

4. In this time i have made a simple user registration and note making way. not so good.

5. I have added note edit note del in one fun

6. i have added a fun to see all the note the user have already now

7. i have added a loop in the main fun so that it will going on continuously until i close it by ctrl + c
